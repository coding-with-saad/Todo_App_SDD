 If I ask you to make me some sub-agents, you will make them.I will give you the topic and the reference form. You have to understand all this and Create a Markdown file that contains the details of sub-agents working on it, rather than creating strange files.





 Update the Gemini.md file based on my project requirements. In this file:

Use Auth Agent for authentication
Use Frontend Agent for frontend development (e.g., Next.js)
Use DB Agent for database design and operations
Use Backend Agent for FastAPI development

Below are my project requirements:
"""
Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application
Basic Level Functionality
Objective: Using Gemini and Spec-Kit Plus transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage.
💡Development Approach: Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via gemini. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.
Requirements
Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application
Create RESTful API endpoints
Build responsive frontend interface
Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database
Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth
Technology Stack

Authentication
Better Auth




Better Auth can be configured to issue JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens when users log in. These tokens are self-contained credentials that include user information and can be verified by any service that knows the secret key.
How It Works
User logs in on Frontend → Better Auth creates a session and issues a JWT token
Frontend makes API call → Includes the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Backend receives request → Extracts token from header, verifies signature using shared secret
Backend identifies user → Decodes token to get user ID, email, etc. and matches it with the user ID in the URL
Backend filters data → Returns only tasks belonging to that user
